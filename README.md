# This is my First MERN Stack APP

A simple ToDo app built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to create, store, and manage their tasks. The app validates user inputs to ensure that both the title and description are provided before storing the task in the database.

## Features

- **Create ToDo Items:** Users can add tasks with a title and description.
- **Input Validation:** The app checks for empty fields and throws an error if either the title or description is missing.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages to guide the user in correcting their input.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Vite (for building and serving the app)
  - CSS (for styling)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for storing the ToDo items)
